üí° For the property type we will be using V7: https://demo29.houzez.co/property/studio-with-city-view/?s_top=v7

</aside>

Bellow you will find all the customizations required explained in details. 

# 1 ) Adding a new Agent Type Called ‚Äúthe **Developer‚Äù**

The current theme settings give only two types, an Agent and An Agency. and we want to add a third one Called the developer which is intended for real estate developers that want to promote their whole projects with us. 

The Developer will have different info to add to the property page that are not available for the Agent or Agency.

the first change we want to apply is replacing the overview section details with these details instead as shown on the image

![L14.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cb6ac629-31a3-4897-867a-92f90c33a908/8c8a6c2f-81d0-44ab-85e8-7f160efe0b96/L14.png)

**DETAILS ADDED EXPLAINED:** 

- Construction status : (Under construction, Ready for Delivery )
- Handover date ( Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 + Year )
- Payment Plan section ( when they click on it they automatically scroll down to the following.
    
    ![L13.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cb6ac629-31a3-4897-867a-92f90c33a908/a56aedc9-7870-48fd-b062-23266dd25d2e/L13.png)
    
- Property type ( Villas, Apartements‚Ä¶ )

<aside>
üí° These additional info will be displayed on their Dashboard to add ( only for the Developer not for the Agent or agency )

</aside>

Note : When someone searches for a developer, the search results should display the Maps listing by default instead of the list view.

Also add the developer on the theme options settings ( Just duplicate the same options that the Agent and Agency have ) Here is a screenshot showing what we mean.

# 2) Changes to the Payment Plan settings

### a) Transfer listings credits from Agency to Agents

We want to simplify things more for the agencies which can have Agents under them. ( this ability is not available for the Developers ) 

On the current system when an agency wants to add an agent they can‚Äôt transfer ‚Äúthe numbers of posts that agent can add‚Äù, and the agent has to buy his own plan which is not convenient at all. 

Now the change we want to do is to give the ability for the Agency to transfer credits to the agent 

This option should be available on their Dashboard. 

### b) Remove the ability for the agent to buy his own plan

**Adjust the membership tab for the agents** 

Since the Agency is gonna be the one adding the credits to the agents there is no need for some information to be displayed for the agent on their membership tab in the Dashboard. 

We will need these two to be removed for agents

# 3‚Äì **Search Options Enhancement**

Add a Map option ( button ) for users to search by Maps or by list ( When a
viewer clicks on the Maps option, they should be automatically
redirected to the Maps view with the same search data. ) like the most
popular websites :

# 4 - Make the property listing clickable

Ensure that clicking anywhere on a property listing redirects to the property details, not just when clicking on the title.

# **5 ‚Äì Additional Filter Customizations**

Add another filter shown above the property list, similar to the one shown on PropertyFinder but with the design style of [Bayut.com](http://bayut.com/).

The filter shows the number of Apartments, Villas, Townhouses, Whole Buildings, Duplexes‚Ä¶

Below you will find a photoshop edit of how we want it to look

![WhatsApp Image 2024-07-27 at 17.13.43.jpeg](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cb6ac629-31a3-4897-867a-92f90c33a908/bc2d4220-2d8d-4db7-a4e4-d755d115d5d7/WhatsApp_Image_2024-07-27_at_17.13.43.jpeg)

# **6 ‚Äì Property Listing Image Size Customization**

We need the logo of the agency to be displayed on the top right of the listing 

Also add the image of the agent below the listing image, as shown on the result that we want below. 

![L4-1-2048x1058.png.webp](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cb6ac629-31a3-4897-867a-92f90c33a908/966fb832-e0f6-4109-a576-745fd94436c7/L4-1-2048x1058.png.webp)

# 7- **Verified Badge**

add a verified badge, similar to ‚ÄúTruCheck‚Äù ‚Äù and ‚ÄúVERIFIED ‚Äù as shown on PropertyFinder and Bayut.

![L3-1-2048x1058.png.webp](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cb6ac629-31a3-4897-867a-92f90c33a908/0a2d46e3-755f-411d-bd3e-ea9c7f366c05/L3-1-2048x1058.png.webp)

We will need additional edits to the CRM for this verified feature to function seamlessly, 

In the CRM, add a feature where agents can upload property documents to request our verification. Once we check and approve these documents, theverified badge should be applied to their properties.

similaire for propretyfinder : https://support.propertyfinder.ae/hc/en-us/articles/12069688916114-Listing-Verification

When the agent clicks on ‚ÄúUpload Document,‚Äù they should see three options:

- Upload Form A
- Upload Title Deed
- Upload Passport
- Other documents

Our team should then have the option to review these documents and decide whether to enable the verified badge or not.

Before they upload these documents they need to check some boxes to confirm that they are following our guidelines 

here is an example of the checklist we want to have 

![WhatsApp Image 2024-07-27 at 17.21.07.jpeg](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cb6ac629-31a3-4897-867a-92f90c33a908/e8168b93-95e7-49c2-9694-34ba016f6fe6/WhatsApp_Image_2024-07-27_at_17.21.07.jpeg)

- [ ]  All images are of supper quality
- [ ]  All images are genuine images of the property showing interior and exterior views
- [ ]  The Watermark is subtle and represents your company logo
- [ ]  images have no footers with extra details
- [ ]  images are not collages or include people

# 8- Statistics

Add statistics in the CRM to track:How many people click on WhatsApp and How many people click on ‚ÄúShow phone‚Äù

**These statistics should be displayed in the ‚ÄúBoard‚Äù**  ‚Äù example the screen below )

![L10-2048x1028.png.webp](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cb6ac629-31a3-4897-867a-92f90c33a908/856789a6-0d27-461b-b1b8-1ddb0e061ee8/L10-2048x1028.png.webp)

**These statistics should be displayed in the ‚ÄúInsight‚Äù tab as well** 

![L11-1-2048x1003.png.webp](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cb6ac629-31a3-4897-867a-92f90c33a908/a86e1ecc-d6ed-4bef-a94b-8ccf5ece070a/L11-1-2048x1003.png.webp)

Also add these stats as icons on this page as well, here is a photoshop image showing where we want it to be displayed, please use a better design

![WhatsApp Image 2024-07-27 at 18.22.57 (1).jpeg](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cb6ac629-31a3-4897-867a-92f90c33a908/8dd8d07f-eab8-4573-ac7d-8c0a861b2731/WhatsApp_Image_2024-07-27_at_18.22.57_(1).jpeg)

This is a breakdown to all the details we mean on the stats area. 

Total Listing  : number of proprety posted via all of the agency agents. 

Views: This will display the number of clicks on each listing after a user searches and clicks on that listing. 

Messages: A Message is counted each time a user sends a message via the form on the property page. 

Phone: is counted each time a user clicks on the phone icon

Whatsapp : is counted each time a user clicks on the Whatsapp icon

Conversion Rate: The percentage of people who view your listing and turns into a lead, views √∑ messages = CRV

# 9) Ads System

We want a simple ad system, where property publishers can boost their listings by displaying them on the first three positions of searches. 

To apply this system we will follow these parameters. 

The ads must be relatable to the searches, meaning if someone searches for an apartments in Dubai they get an ad for an apartment in the same area ( which is what‚Äôs gonna get the priority ) not an apartment somewhere else or a villa

the ads price will be fixed, if we have 7 people publishing ads on the same area while we offer only three places, they will switch up randomly.

Also on the CRM we will need a custom page where they can follow the performance of their ads, like how many impressions, the terms they showed up for, and how many clicks. 

+ ofc they need to have a button on their listing edit where they can sponsor that particular listing / buy a package where the credits get consumed based on impressions. 

# 10 ) Packages

Please develop a new pricing plan similar to the one shown in the screenshots below.

We need plans for both "Agency" and "Promoter" with the following structure:

**Pricing Plans :**

Duration Options: 3 months, 6 months, 12 months

Each duration option should have three plans: Basic, Advanced, Pro

Example:

        Agency Basic (3 months): 5 Litings, 13 USD
        Agency Advanced (6 months): 10 Litings, 24 USD
        Agency Pro (12 months): 20 Litings, 48 USD

![P1.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cb6ac629-31a3-4897-867a-92f90c33a908/e2c2e215-d73a-4487-86d8-5f2a031ec015/P1.png)

**Developer Plans:**

Duration Options: Only 6 months, 12 months

Each duration option should have three plans: Basic, Advanced, Pro
    
Example:

        Advanced Developer (6 months): 12 Listings, 27 USD
        Pro Developer (12 months): 20 Listings, 43 USD

**Additionally, all packs should include:**

Backend to manage prospects and properties
Translation of ads into all languages on the site
Project ranking in the new construction section
Other features as listed in the screenshots

# 11 ) Updates to Developer Search Feature

I have a few updates and changes I'd like to implement on the developer search feature:

1. **Hide "Verified Listings First"**: Please remove this filter from the current options.

    - Q2 2025
    - Q3 2025

    - 2027
    - 2028
    - 2029
