# Houzez Theme Customization


The issue for personalizing greetings has been addressed. Now, there's
another issue with Houzez that I'd like to solve.
As you may know, the theme provides a "Save Search" button. However, the
"Saved Searches" page looks useless. It only recorded (property)type (see
the screenshot attached).



What we want is when users want to save their search results and click
"Save Search" button, their own "Saved Searches" page in their dashboard
should includes the following information:
Location (City, State, Country), Space type, Price(Rent) range, Size
range, Date Saved, Action button



For example, the saved searches page should look like this:
Atlanta, Georgia, United States, Office, $20-$25/sf/year, 700 sf - 1000
sf, September 6, 2024 Action (Button)
Action: View Listings, Edit, Manage Notifications, Delete
